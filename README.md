# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project uses the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle to predict passenger survival using supervised machine learning techniques. The models are evaluated using key classification metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

## Overview

- *Goal:* Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, etc.
- *Dataset:* Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)
- *Tech Stack:* Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Technologies and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Highlights

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., encoding, filling missing values)
- Training and comparing multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance using classification metrics
- Basic experimentation with TensorFlow integration
## How to Run
